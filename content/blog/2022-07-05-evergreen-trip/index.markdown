## A Reunion at Greenlakes

On July 3, 2022, we visited Greenlakes Park with several friends living in Syracuse. The park is only 10 miles from Syracuse and is strikingly scenic. They say that a picture is worth a thousand word and so I will save myself some time and let the following picture do the talking:

While touring such a beautiful place individually can be great, being in a company of friends makes the experience even better. The kids (Morgan, Keon, Kini) got a chance to play with each other as the adults used the moment to catch up after a very long Winter. We did a barbecue (chicken, beef ribs, sausages, etc) at the park. It was a good day indeed.

There are very many things to do at the park and a single afternoon cannot be enough to do even half of them. You can camp, kayak, sand bathe, swim, golf, etc. Greenlakes has a lake with two layers of water that do not mix. Such a lake is called a meromictic lake and such lakes are extremely rare - by the time of this writing, we have only 36 meromictic lakes in the world. Here is a video:
