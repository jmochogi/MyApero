## A Reunion at Green Lakes

On July 3, 2022, we visited Green Lakes State Park with several friends living in Syracuse. The park is only 10 miles from Syracuse and is strikingly scenic. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words so I will save some time and let the following picture do the talking:

While touring such a beautiful place individually can be great, being in a company of friends makes the experience even better. The kids (Morgan, Keon, and Kini) got a chance to play together as the adults used the moment to catch up after a very long winter. We did a barbecue (chicken, beef ribs, sausages, and corn) at the park. It was a good day indeed.

There are very many things to do at the park and a single afternoon cannot be enough to do even half of them. You can camp, kayak, sand bathe, swim, golf, etc. Greenlakes has a lake with two layers of water that do not mix. Such a lake is called a meromictic lake and such lakes are extremely rare - by the time of this writing, we have only 36 meromictic lakes in the world. Here is a video:
