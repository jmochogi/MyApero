  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a professor of mathematics at Ithaca College in New York, United States. Before coming to Ithaca, I taught at Syracuse University where I was also pursuing my PhD. Prior to that, I taught high school mathematics and chemistry in Kenya for 4 years where I also served as the Head of Science/Mathematics department. My current research interests include undergraduate mathematics education with a focus on studentsâ€™ mathematical reasoning as well as problem posing and solving.
