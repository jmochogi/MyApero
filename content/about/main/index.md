  I am working on two research projects. One is looking at how open-source statistics textbooks provide opportunities for undergraduate students in introductory statistics courses to engage in various forms of reasoning. The other is examining forms of interactions between problem posing and problem solving in the context of basic financial mathematics.
  
  I am also taking baby steps at learning photography. I am at around 25%. Central and Upstate New York are very beautiful and I want to document and share that beauty using the best pictures that I can capture. Occasionally, I get opportunities to travel out of New York and I like to take a picture or two for memories.
